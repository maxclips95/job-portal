# Cursor Rules - Job Portal Resume

## Objective
Continue this project in strict sequence until production readiness, with no drift.

## Mandatory Startup Steps
1. Read `phase-progress/BLUEPRINT_PRODUCTION_SEQUENCE_2026-02-09.md`.
2. Read `AGENT_HANDOFF.md`.
3. Resume from the exact step marked in the sequence file.

## Execution Rules
- Follow `S1 -> S7` in order. Do not jump steps.
- Update `phase-progress/BLUEPRINT_PRODUCTION_SEQUENCE_2026-02-09.md` after each completed step.
- Keep changes deployment-agnostic in current phase (no Docker/K8s dependency).
- Do not revert unrelated existing edits.
- Prefer minimal, testable patches.

## Current Required Resume Point
- Start at `S4` (frontend production build gate and route/data parity).
- `S1`, `S2`, `S3` are completed.

## Verification Commands
- `npm run local:status`
- `npm run build --prefix=backend`
- `npm run build --prefix=frontend`
- `npm run local:start`
- `npm run local:stop`

## If Blocked
- Record blocker + exact command output summary in sequence file.
- Add precise next action and stop.
